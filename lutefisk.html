    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>
        Ah, lutefisk! The culinary delight that challenges the very definition of "delicious." This traditional Norwegian dish features dried cod or whitefish that's been soaked in a magical concoction of lye, resulting in a flavor profile that can best be described as... unique. Despite its polarizing taste and aroma reminiscent of a chemical spill, lutefisk maintains its status as a holiday staple, perhaps more for its comedic value than its gastronomic appeal.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Dried cod or whitefish (for the brave)</li>
        <li>Lye (food-grade, because we're nothing if not cautious)</li>
        <li>Water (to dilute the impending disaster)</li>
        <li>Salt (to add insult to injury)</li>
        <li>Potatoes, boiled or mashed (for distraction)</li>
        <li>Peas, carrots, or other vegetables (to offer false hope of a balanced meal)</li>
        <li>Butter or white sauce (to drown your sorrows)</li>
        <li>Lingonberry sauce or other condiments (to mask the taste... or at least try)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak the dried cod in a lye solution for several days, because apparently, regular seasoning just isn't adventurous enough.</li>
        <li>Rinse the fish thoroughly to remove any residual lye, because nobody wants their meal to double as a household cleaner.</li>
        <li>Cook the rehydrated fish by boiling or steaming until it becomes tender and translucent, or until you've sufficiently questioned your life choices.</li>
        <li>While the fish is cooking, prepare accompaniments such as boiled or mashed potatoes, peas, carrots, and white sauce, because let's face it, you're going to need distractions.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, serve the lutefisk hot with the prepared accompaniments and any desired condiments, such as lingonberry sauce, because desperate times call for desperate measures.</li>
        <li>Enjoy this traditional Norwegian delicacy as part of a festive holiday meal, and savor the unique flavors and textures of lutefisk... or at least try to.</li>
    </ol>
